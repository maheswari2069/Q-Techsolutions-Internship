# Spam Email Detection System (Naive Bayes Classifier)

This project implements a **Spam Email Detection System** using a **Naive Bayes** classifier to classify emails as "Spam" or "Not Spam" based on their content. The system utilizes a pre-trained model and a TF-IDF vectorizer to transform and classify emails, providing an easy-to-use and interactive interface for users to test classification with their own email content.

## Features
- **Fast and Accurate**: Classifies emails quickly and accurately using the Naive Bayes algorithm.
- **Interactive**: Users can input their email content and instantly get classification results.
- **Visual**: The app provides visual feedback with icons indicating whether an email is spam or not.
- **Secure**: The system processes the email content locally, ensuring privacy.

## Naive Bayes Classifier

The core of this spam email detection system is a **Naive Bayes classifier**, which is a probabilistic machine learning model based on Bayes' Theorem. It is particularly effective for text classification tasks due to its simplicity and speed.

The **Naive Bayes** algorithm is well-suited for the problem of spam detection because it works well with high-dimensional data (like the bag-of-words representation used here) and can efficiently handle large datasets.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Maheswari-184/Q-Techsolutions-Internship.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd spam-email-detection
   ```

3. Create a virtual environment and install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # For macOS/Linux
   venv\Scripts\activate     # For Windows
   ```

4. Install the dependencies from `requirements.txt`:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Make sure you have the pre-trained model and vectorizer files:
   - `spam_model.pkl`: The trained Naive Bayes model.
   - `tfidf_vectorizer.pkl`: The TF-IDF vectorizer used to transform email content.

2. Run the Streamlit app:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

3. Once the app is running, open the provided local URL in your browser to start classifying emails.

## Pages

The app has two pages:
1. **Home**: Classify your email content as "Spam" or "Not Spam".
2. **Accuracy Metrics**: View the accuracy and classification report of the Naive Bayes model.

## Accuracy Metrics

- The model evaluates its performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- The results are displayed in an easy-to-read classification report format.

## Technologies Used

- **Streamlit**: For building the interactive web application.
- **scikit-learn**: For implementing the Naive Bayes classifier and vectorization.
- **pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations.
- **Pickle**: For saving and loading the trained Naive Bayes model and vectorizer.
- **Pillow**: For image processing.
