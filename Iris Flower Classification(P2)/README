# Iris Flower Classification ðŸŒ¸

## Objective
The goal of this project is to predict the species of an Iris flower based on its physical features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. Using machine learning models, specifically **Decision Trees** and **k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)**, this project demonstrates how to classify the Iris species accurately based on these features.

## Dataset
This project uses the **Iris dataset**, which is built into the **scikit-learn** library. The dataset contains 150 samples of Iris flowers and includes the following features:
- **Sepal Length (cm)**
- **Sepal Width (cm)**
- **Petal Length (cm)**
- **Petal Width (cm)**

The target variable is the **species** of the flower, which can be one of the following:
- **Setosa**
- **Versicolor**
- **Virginica**

## Techniques
### 1. **Decision Trees**
   - A Decision Tree classifier is used to model the relationship between flower features and their corresponding species. This model splits the data based on feature values to make decisions at each node.

### 2. **k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)**
   - The k-NN algorithm classifies an iris flower by finding the 'k' nearest neighbors in the feature space. The majority class among the neighbors determines the classification.

## Features
- **User Input**: Allows the user to input flower measurements using interactive sliders.
- **Prediction**: Predicts the Iris flower species based on the entered measurements.
- **Model Performance**: Displays the accuracy of the models used (Decision Tree and k-NN).
- **Dataset Insights**: Provides an overview of the Iris dataset, including the range of each feature and a preview of the dataset.

## Requirements
To run the application, you need the following libraries:
- `streamlit`
- `pandas`
- `scikit-learn`
- `plotly`

Install these dependencies with the following command:

```bash
pip install streamlit pandas scikit-learn plotly
```

## How to Run the Application

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory where the code files are located.
3. Run the Streamlit app using the following command:

```bash
streamlit run iris_app.py  
```
```python
python -m streamlit run iris_app.py  
```


This will start a local web server, and the application will open in your default web browser.

## Project Files

### `iris_model.py`
Contains the following functions:
- **`load_data()`**: Loads the Iris dataset from scikit-learn, returning the data as a Pandas DataFrame and the target species names.
- **`preprocess_data()`**: Prepares the data by scaling the features and splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.
- **`train_and_evaluate_models()`**: Trains and evaluates the **Decision Tree** and **k-NN** models, returning their performance metrics.

### `iris_app.py`
The main Streamlit application file that:
- Displays sliders to collect input from the user for predicting Iris flower species.
- Uses the trained models to predict the species based on the user input.
- Displays a comparison of model accuracies and results, along with insights into the Iris dataset.

## Code Explanation

### Loading and Preprocessing Data
- **`load_data()`**: Loads the Iris dataset and returns the data as a DataFrame along with target names.
- **`preprocess_data()`**: Splits the data into features and target variables, applies feature scaling, and splits the data into training and testing sets.

### Model Training and Evaluation
- **`train_and_evaluate_models()`**: Trains the models (Decision Tree and k-NN) on the training data, evaluates their accuracy on the testing data, and returns the results.

### Streamlit Web Application
- **User Input**: Collects inputs for sepal and petal lengths and widths via sliders.
- **Prediction**: The userâ€™s input is scaled using the same scaling method used during training and passed to the best-performing model for prediction.
- **Results**: The app displays the predicted species and the model's accuracy along with a comparison of the models' performance.

## Model Performance
Two models are used:
- **Decision Tree**: A classification model that builds a tree-like structure to make decisions based on feature values.
- **k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)**: A non-parametric method where the class is determined by the majority vote of the nearest neighbors in the feature space.

## Dataset
The **Iris dataset** consists of 150 samples with four features for each sample:
- Sepal Length
- Sepal Width
- Petal Length
- Petal Width

The target variable is the species, which can be one of the three species: **Setosa**, **Versicolor**, and **Virginica**.
