# E-Commerce Product Recommendation 🛍️

## 🎯 Objective

The goal of this project is to build a **Product Recommendation System** that suggests products to users based on their browsing history and behavior. The system is designed to recommend products that are similar to what the user has shown interest in, enhancing the shopping experience on e-commerce platforms.

## 📊 Dataset

The system uses **Amazon Product Data** to generate recommendations. The dataset contains information about various products, such as:

- **`product_name`**: Name of the product 🏷️
- **`category`**: Category to which the product belongs 📂
- **`about_product`**: A description of the product 📝
- **`rating`**: Customer ratings of the product ⭐
- **`img_link`**: Link to an image of the product 📸
- **`product_link`**: URL to the product page 🔗

## 🔧 Techniques

This recommendation system uses **Content-Based Filtering**, which suggests products based on their features and how similar they are to the products a user has interacted with. The system combines textual features such as the product name, category, and description to calculate similarities using **Cosine Similarity**.

### Key Components:
- **TfidfVectorizer**: Converts the product features (name, category, description) into numerical vectors 🔢
- **Cosine Similarity**: Measures the similarity between the input query and the products in the dataset 📐

## 🌟 Features

- **🔍 Search for Products**: Users can search for a product by typing in keywords, and the app will recommend similar products.
- **📦 Product Recommendations**: Based on the user's input, the system provides up to 5 recommended products.
- **📋 Product Information**: The recommendations display relevant product details such as the name, category, rating, and a link to view more details.

## 🛠️ Requirements

To run this app locally, you need the following Python libraries:

- **Streamlit**: Web framework for building interactive applications 🌐
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation 📊
- **Scikit-learn**: For machine learning, vectorization, and similarity calculation 🤖
- **Numpy**: For numerical operations ➗

## 📝 Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Maheswari-184/Q-Techsolutions-Internship.git
   cd Q-Techsolutions-Internship
   ```

2. Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   If `requirements.txt` is unavailable, manually install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install streamlit pandas scikit-learn numpy
   ```

4. Ensure the **Amazon Product Data** (`amazon.csv`) is in the `data/` directory. The dataset should include columns like:
   - `product_name`
   - `category`
   - `about_product`
   - `img_link`
   - `rating`
   - `product_link`

## 🚀 Running the App

To run the app locally, use the following command:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

Once the app starts, open your browser and go to `http://localhost:8501` to interact with the recommendation system.

## 🔍 How It Works

1. **Search**: Users can input a product name or keyword in the search bar 🔎
2. **Recommendations**: The system computes the similarity between the query and the products in the dataset and returns the top 5 most similar products 💡
3. **Product Details**: Each recommended product includes:
   - Product name 🏷️
   - Product category 📂
   - Product rating ⭐
   - A link to view more details on the e-commerce platform 🔗

## 🎨 Customization

- **Header Color**: You can change the color of the header and other UI elements by modifying the custom CSS in the Streamlit app 🎨
- **Enhancements**: Additional features like user login, history tracking, or using collaborative filtering can be added for improved recommendations 🚀
